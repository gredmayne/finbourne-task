This project implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache in C#. 

It is designed to be reusable, extensible, and easy to integrate into systems that require efficient memory management and fast data access.
The cache stores key-value pairs and automatically evicts the least recently used item when its capacity is exceeded. It also has a notification mechanism for evictions, making it suitable for scenarios where cache needs to be monitored.

Approximate time spent: _ hours.
